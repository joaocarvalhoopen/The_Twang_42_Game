# Description: A funny, simple and very additive game for the PC, based on
#              Twang32 for the ESP32 that uses a LED strip.
#              This is the Twang 42 game. A very simple and partial re-implementation
# for the PC, of the game Twang32 for the ESP32 microcontroller that uses a LED strip
# and a joystick made with a door Twang spring. See the video of the original
# [TWANG32 LED Strip Game Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXpfa-ZvUMA) I wanted
# to make this game for my daughter and I didn't had a LED strip nor an accelerometer.
# So I made a simple PC version hack during two days of work.
# I wanted to make it in 3D, so that it retained the cool aspect of the perspective
# of the LED strip that you can see in the video. But I wanted to make something fast
# so my daughter could play soon. With that in mind I choose the Python programming
# Language for this project. For the 3D API I taught of PyOpenGL, PyGame and Pandas3D,
# but I have little, rusty, or no experience with those API's, so I asked around and a
# friend suggested that I used the TK API (Tkinter in Python). That is a GUI API that
# has a Canvas 2D Widget with functions to draw polygons and that I could implemented
# the mathematics of the projection of a 3D world in a 2D world using the draw polygons
# functions. I searched around on the internet and found a small example in Stack
# Overflow of a small example code that did that. But that had an error, and that was
# why the person has posted the code. [How to display tkinter polygons on canvas under
# 3D conditions?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54043171/how-to-display-tkinter-polygons-on-canvas-under-3d-conditions)
# I have corrected the error and I give the corrected file hear [cube.py](./cube.py).
# This program draws a 3D cube inside TK API and makes it spin in different directions
# depending on the mouse position. It didn't draw the faces of the cube correctly, the
# version I give hear is the some code but with the correction of the Z ordered drawing
# of the polygons and some very small addictions.
# Then I started with this and changed almost everything in the code except the math
# of the projections, I hacked away all the 3D graphic part until it was finished. 
# Then I started on the game partial re-implementation ... I studied all the code, but
# the rendering engine was really different and I wanted to implement a much simpler
# version (partial implementation), so I used an adaptation of the Enemy class from the
# original code and made my own custom version of all the rest. Following the game play
# that I had seen on the original Twang32 video.
#
